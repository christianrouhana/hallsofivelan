# Halls of Ivelan
Halls of Ivelan is a roguelike project inspired by 80s games like Rogue and Nethack. This is a very early build of the game rolled out for Windows only so anyone interested can test for critical bugs. Please feel free to message me or email [rouhanachristian@gmail.com] critiques and advice. This project started from a tutorial [http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/], and I then started to make changes and give it a life of its own. I look forwards to creating the final product!
